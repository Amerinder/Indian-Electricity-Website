        <h2>Statistics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Global Energy Consumption:</strong> In 2019, global energy consumption was around 168,000 terawatt-hours (TWh). Renewable energy sources accounted for approximately 19% of the total energy consumption.</li>
            <li><strong>Renewable Energy Growth:</strong> The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that renewable energy capacity grew by 45% from 2010 to 2019.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Efficiency Improvements:</strong> The IEA also reported that improvements in energy efficiency contributed to a 12% reduction in global energy intensity (energy consumption per unit of GDP) from 2010 to 2019.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Consumption by Sector:</strong> The industrial sector is a significant energy consumer, accounting for about 37% of global final energy consumption in 2019, followed by transportation (32%) and residential/commercial (31%).</li>
            <li><strong>Electricity Consumption:</strong> The global electricity demand is steadily increasing. In 2019, it was estimated at around 23,000 TWh.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Efficiency Policies:</strong> Many countries have implemented energy efficiency policies. For example, the International Energy Agency reported that in 2019, more than 30 countries had implemented mandatory energy efficiency standards for appliances.</li>
            <li><strong>Buildings and Energy Consumption:</strong> Buildings are responsible for a significant portion of energy consumption. In the United States, residential and commercial buildings accounted for about 40% of total energy consumption in 2019.</li>
            <li><strong>Transportation Sector:</strong> The transportation sector is a major contributor to energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts to improve the energy efficiency of vehicles and promote alternative fuels are ongoing.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Conservation Initiatives:</strong> Various energy conservation initiatives, such as energy-saving programs, energy audits, and public awareness campaigns, have been implemented globally to promote responsible energy use.</li>
            <li><strong>Government Targets and Agreements:</strong> Many countries have set targets and commitments to reduce energy consumption and increase the share of renewable energy in their energy mix. Agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to limit global temperature increases by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
        </ul>
